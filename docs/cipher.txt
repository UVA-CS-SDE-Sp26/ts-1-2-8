The pseudocode below outlines the nature of the 2 classes involved in deciphering
PSEUDOCODE:
CLASS Cipher

    METHOD loadKey(keyPath)
        OPEN file at keyPath
        READ first line = plain
        READ second line = cipher
        CLOSE file

        IF length(plain) != length(cipher)
            THROW IllegalArgumentException

        RETURN new CipherKey(plain, cipher)
    END METHOD


    METHOD decipher(input, key)
        plain = key.getPlain()
        cipher = key.getCipher()
        answer = empty string

        FOR each character c in input
            position ← indexOf(c) in cipher
            IF position ≥ 0
                answer += plain.charAt(position)
            ELSE
                answer += c
        END FOR

        RETURN answer
    END METHOD

END CLASS


CLASS CipherKey

    CONSTRUCTOR(plain, cipher)
        this.plain = plain
        this.cipher = cipher
    END CONSTRUCTOR

    METHOD getPlain()
        RETURN plain
    END METHOD

    METHOD getCipher()
        RETURN cipher
    END METHOD

END CLASS

FUNCTIONALITY:
  Cipher class:
    Handles the logic for the substitution cipher
    Reads a key file that defines character mappings and checks that it is valid
    This is used to decrypt text by replacing each encrypted character with its matching plaintext character
    It handles both file input and the decryption process

  CipherKey class:
    Stores the plaintext and ciphertext character sequences
    It provides access to these strings so the Cipher class can can function during decryption
